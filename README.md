Resilience analysis of Power Distribution Systems
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adaptation/Extension of the PySDAL library for simulating the power flow of a power distribution network.
Find details in this paper:
Fosso Olav B 2020 PyDSAL - Python Distribution System Analysis Library - IEEE POWERCON

To start the program and analyse the power loss for the IEEE-69 network please use DistFlow
python DistLoadFlow

The output is the active and reactive power loss of the example system. 

This program extension is an initial state and will be developed towards a network-based resilience analysis.
